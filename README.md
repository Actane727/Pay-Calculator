# Pay-Calculator
## Python practice calculator for pay

  I am starting a new path with cybersecurity and wanted to start polishing up on my, somewhat basic, knowledge of Python.  I have created things before, but 
wanted to try to build something from scratch, since it had been so long.  I recently have been in lots of conversations with colleagues about the shrinking
pay gap between hourly and management employees.  Since I have been crunching numbers to figure the math on some things, I figured I would just build my own
calculator to figure it all out for me.  Then I started adding features to show just how bad the gap really is, considering us managers are salary.  I hope
that you enjoy this, and I have thrown a little humor in it for fun.
